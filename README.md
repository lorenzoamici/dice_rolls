# Multiple dice rolls simulator and plotter

This script populates two arrays a1 and a2 with n1 and n2 different random dice rolls. then it computes the percentual probability of every outcome (1 to 6) in both the arrays and plots the probabilities in the same figure.

The idea is that if n1>n2 then the line representing the dice rolls of a1 should be more flat and distributed near the 1/6 (or 16,666...%) probability. You can check out **dice_rolls.png** to see an example of the output of the script.

### Necessary packages:
